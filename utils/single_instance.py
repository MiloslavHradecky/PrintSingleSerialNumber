📦 Module: single_instance_checker.py

Utility for preventing multiple instances of the application.

Responsibilities:
    - Use QSharedMemory to detect if another instance is already running
    - Block duplicate launches by checking shared memory attachment
    - Used during application startup to enforce single-instance behavior
