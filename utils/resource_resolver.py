"""
ðŸ“¦ Module: resource_resolver.py

Provides the ResourceResolver class for consistent and environment-aware file path resolution.

Purpose:
- Ensure reliable access to resource files in both development and bundled (.exe) environments
- Resolve paths from configuration (absolute or relative)
- Provide writable paths for logs, outputs, and temp files
- Centralize path logic for maintainability and testability

Highlights:
- Detects runtime context (standard vs PyInstaller)
- Supports config-driven path resolution
- Designed for future extensibility and mocking
- Keeps file access consistent across platforms

Usage:
    resolver = ResourceResolver()
    config_path = resolver.config()
    log_path = resolver.writable("logs/app.log")
    data_file = resolver.resource("data/items.json")
